\subsection{Scope}
\subsubsection{Definitions and limits}

FrostByte is a company that currently has a large pool of information about old and current TV-shows, and has for a long time had a web interface to present this information to its users.\\
As a result of increased competition from other actors on the market, and a strong need for better functionality, a new system titled EpisodeGuide will be developed.

The project will eventually result in a robust system allowing users to register accounts, which will provide them with functionality exclusive to registered users.\\
It’ll also be possible to provide users with premium functionality for a small monthly fee.\\
Administrating the system and distributing new information to the users should be made simple and smooth, by utilizing new and innovative technology and services. 

FrostByte already has a platform / web-interface built on an old but working code base, and they’d like to see some of the old functionality migrated to the new system.\\
As branches of the platform, mobile applications should be developed to allow for communication with the platforms API. The mobile applications should be released primarily for iOS, Android and Windows Phone.

From a security perspective, because sensitive data such as credit card information and personal user data may be stored, it’s important that this data is treated, transmitted and stored in a secure manner. Because of this, FrostByte has entered a partnership with MasterCard/VISA for secure payment solutions.
