\subsubsection{Discussion of overall development method}
The development company consists of six skilled people with broad expertise within web-technology and development. The project consists of a variety of different development methods and the complexity is rather high; thus it is expected that development will take around 10 months to reach completion.\\
With such a system, it’s highly plausible the product owner change their mind regularly as a result of feedback from users. The project builds on an existing system and existing users, and thus is not considered a high risk factor.\\

SCRUM has been chosen as the development methodology, mainly because a sprint time of 14 days will help in providing incremental revisions that can be tested by both product owner and user testing group. This is especially important because of the risk of changes being made to the project. The project requirements may be modified according to product owner’s and users’ feedback, which is why it’s important to continuously review previously completed functionality to improve or make changes to the code.
The system is developed by a relatively small team, something which requires each employee to complete their respective tasks within the given time frame. With SCRUM sprints it will be simpler to measure success and workload to make sure a consistent and stable workflow is maintained.
