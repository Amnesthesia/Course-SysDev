\subsubsection{Comments on Use Case Diagram}
In the use case diagram we have five entities which make up the flow of the application.
The user, and also the main entity, is the one that interacts with most of the parts of the application (exluding: backup system and administration).
The administrator is the entity that adds data to the database (ie. new shows and/or episodes) or sends out newsletter.
\\
In our model we have one external entity; the payment system. This system allows the users to upgrade their account and pay their subscription fee directly via the web application.
The application communicates with the payment backend (ie. Visa/Mastercard) over a secure channel.\\
The backup system, as of today, only have one job; on regular intervals, make a backup of all the user accounts and associated data.
